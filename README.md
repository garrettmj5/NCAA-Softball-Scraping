# NCAA-Softball-Scraping
I developed a web scraping script designed to extract key data from box scores of various teams.
The code collects information such as the gameâ€™s box score, the corresponding URL, and the name of the home plate umpire. From the excel sheet this was then transferred to Trumedia so the umpire "zone" could be matched with the umpire name. The data was then utilized to analyze umpire tendencies, providing teams with insights into potential pitch-call preferences of the umpire during a game.
